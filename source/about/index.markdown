Hi there,

My name is Natasha, and I like to figure out how to make technical (and technological) things work. I am also disgustingly geeky. The depth of my geekdom scares me sometimes. Nevertheless, I have been keeping notes on my adventures in tech for several years. This blog is an attempt to share some of those adventures with you. 

In my professional life I am a Biomedical Engineer, IT Consultant and sometimes Web Developer. The intersection of those pursuits being the use of technology to accomplish tasks that could not be done otherwise. Well... Actually, the web stuff is just because I like creating pretty things. 

I will do my best to stay on topic, with the topic being tutorials and the occasional technology should just work rant. However, do not be surprised if I veer off into the "this geeky thing is super cool" territory every now and again. 

Getting this blog up and running was in and of itself an adventure in tech. Points To Note:

1. It is a "baked blog" running on [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/). It works, but my endgame is to find a Dropbox/Markdown solution that works consistently. 

2, The theme, because I was lazy setting this up, is an __unmodified__ implementation of Mike Clarke's [Villainy](https://github.com/mikeclarke/villainy-octopress-theme) theme.
