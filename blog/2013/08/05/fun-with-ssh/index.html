<p>I decided to go out of town for two weeks sans laptop. What I have instead is a nexus 7, bluetooth keyboard, and an ssh connection to my main laptop. The setup is almost perfect. The only thing that could make this better is the ability to send my beloved macbook to sleep when it is not in use. Why not use wake on lan you ask? Because, my friends, Cisco has decided that WOL is bad, and should not be allowed.</p>

<p>Cisco isnt stupid, so I am going to assume that there is a very good reason for disallowing WOL but it is a pain in the butt. Normally, I would have just replaced the Cisco firmware with DD-WRT which does allow WOL and be done with it, but I like their fancy new linksys smart wifi interface. It works, and most importantly it is simple enough that my spouse could use it if necessary. I have discovered the joys of saying &ldquo;Let me show you how to do that.&rdquo;
So now WOL for me. Ehh. It is only two weeks.  &mdash;</p>
